But she was modest about her work, friends and relatives recall. \r\n\r\n\r\nA shy person, when she first met the parents of her boyfriend, Marco Gottardi, she hid behind their huge kitchen fridge, embarrassed because she had been brought back to the house overnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n“She tiptoed into our lives … but as we got to know her, she was a ray of light,” says Marco’s mother, Daniela. “She was very beautiful and caring. I knew exactly why my son wanted to be with her. They had a great love between them, she always had her arms wrapped around him.” \r\n\r\n\r\nThe 26-year-old from Camposampiero in northern Italy had moved to London with Gottardi in March 2017. The couple spent their first couple of weeks in the city doing an English-language course before setting out to find work. \r\n\r\n\r\nTrevisan was quickly snapped up by Peregrine Bryant Architecture. At the time of the Grenfell Tower fire, she had been with the studio in south-west London for less than two weeks, assigned to work on a refurbishment of the Grade I-listed Soane Stables buildings at the Royal Chelsea hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n“She was very impressive and very quickly understood the building. She did one drawing, which was first class,” says the company’s senior partner, Peregrine Bryant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrevisan worked on a team led by a fellow Italian architect, Laura Morgante.\r\n\r\n\r\n“She had the kind of knowledge about conservation that is usually very difficult to find in the UK,” says Morgante. “Her work was outstanding, and we were very happy for her to be working with us. She was very happy in London and was getting the kind of hands-on experience that is sometimes hard to come by in Italy.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practice set up an annual scholarship in the couple’s honour. Called the Gloria e Marco Award, it will support a graduate from the university they attended, Università Iuav di Venezia, to come to the UK to learn more about conservation.","Credit":"Angela Giuffrida"},{"Name":"Marco Gottardi","Floor":"23","Age":"27","Nationality":"Italian","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a7178cd63adb551186579ff572504ce0ef1167e/402_97_558_558/140.jpg","Short-biog":"\"That night he was serene; he tried to keep his parents and girlfriend calm\"","Long-biog":"As a schoolboy, Marco Gottardi was already such an altruist that he once deliberately underperformed in a set of exams so he did not outshine his friends. \r\n\r\n\r\n“He never wanted to be the centre of attention,” says his father, Gianni. People who knew Marco describe him invariably as a gentlemen, selfless, and as a “man from a different era” who valued tradition. “He wished he’d lived during the 1970s,” says his mother, Daniela. “He used to say that those were better times.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGottardi grew up in San Stino di Livenza, a small town in northern Italy. He was passionate about ice-skating from an early age, winning several competitions before discovering football and becoming a loyal Juventus fan. He was an only child but was rarely alone, relishing the company of others. His parents often hosted parties, whether to celebrate his birthday, the end of the school year or his graduation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGottardi studied quantity surveying before settling on architecture. Along with his girlfriend of three years, Gloria Trevisan, the 27-year-old moved to London in March 2017 to move forward with his career and to learn English. The couple planned the move meticulously, and despite arriving without work, they were quickly hired. \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a tiring search, they were also relieved to find an apartment they adored on the 23rd floor of Grenfell tower, moving in less than two months before the fire. “They did everything all by themselves, and they succeeded,” says Gianni.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the couple embarked on their new lives, they kept their families updated via a WhatsApp group, sending photos of themselves around the city, among new friends, eating fish and chips and drinking beer – a first for Gottardi. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe was seen as calm, collected and sensitive to the feelings of others, traits he maintained during a call home before he died. “He told us there was smoke but was certain the rescuers would arrive. He was serene; he tried to keep his parents and girlfriend calm,” says Gianni.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe couple had been due to travel home to celebrate Gottardi’s 28th birthday on 26 June. \r\n\r\n\r\nHis parents have established a foundation called Grenfellove Marco and Gloria, which they hope will help other young Italians get a good start in life. “They were two people who had the great strength to start a professional path abroad all by themselves,” says Gianni Gottardi. “By setting this up, we can help others and remember them always.”","Credit":"​​​​​​​​Angela Giuffrida"},{"Name":"Omar Belkadi","Floor":"20","Age":"32","Nationality":"British-Moroccan","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd7cb8df5ec1b7fb81413cb3b3c929b13c57fdcf/388_0_1146_1146/140.jpg","Short-biog":"\"His final journey was back to Morocco, where he was buried\"","Long-biog":"Omar Belkadi died in the Grenfell Tower fire along with his wife, Farah Hamdan, and two of their daughters, Leena and Malek.

He worked as a porter at the hospital for 22 years and travelled to work on the tube each day from Latimer Road. \r\nHaving worked in two garages after leaving school, he found that hospital work suited him. In a statement, a week after the fire, UCLH chief executive Marcel Levi described him as an “extremely dedicated and hugely popular member of staff” and a “larger than life character” who never failed to show “kindness and compassion to patients and colleagues”.\r\nEl Wahabi spent his early childhood in the coastal town of Larache in northern Morocco before being brought to London with his siblings by his mother after his father settled in the Portobello Road area. The family had planned to return to Morocco but instead put down roots in the community in North Kensington, where El Wahabi attended Isaac Newton secondary school in Lancaster Road.\r\nHe had a strong interest in Moroccan culture, and sought his mother’s advice when he wanted to get married, and professional Bedouin musicians played at his wedding to Faouzia in Larache.

When she died, she was getting ready to teach a knitting and crochet class at the Westway Trust community centre, where she sold her handmade scarves and baby clothes, with the profits going back to the trust. \r\n\r\n\r\nUntil she married and moved to London aged 20 in 1995, Faouzia had lived in Larache, a coastal town in northern Morocco, with her parents and grandmother. She had known her future husband, Abdulaziz El Wahabi, and his family all her life. When the pair were reintroduced by older relatives after Abdulaziz told them of his wish to settle down, they fell in love.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn London, they moved in with her mother-in-law until they were offered a two-bedroom flat in Grenfell Tower when her first child, Yasin, was one. Yasin, his aunt remembers, was a difficult baby who childminders struggled with, and Faouzia’s early attempts at working outside the home in a school kitchen were given up in favour of full-time parenting.  \r\n\r\n\r\nYasin was followed by a daughter, Nur Huda, with whom Faouzia enjoyed following Moroccan dramas and soap operas on TV. Then there was a seven-year gap before Mehdi, the baby of the family, arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n“You would always see her laughing and joking with her children, whenever you saw her out they would be with her,” says her sister-in-law and former neighbour, Hanan Wahabi. “That’s how she was with them, and every single one of them was a parent to Mehdi – it was a unique situation they had.” \r\n\r\n\r\n“There was a real sweetness to her, but beneath that there was a real desire to ensure her children got on,” says David Sellens, the headteacher at Thomas Jones school where two of the El Wahabis’ children were pupils.","Credit":"Susanna Rustin"},{"Name":"Yasin El Wahabi","Floor":"21","Age":"20","Nationality":"Moroccan","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/e95f42ba0ee8b0feca49147d63639788240b8429/234_93_277_277/140.jpg","Short-biog":"\"The first of his family to go to university, he hoped one day to own his own business\"","Long-biog":"A part-time accountancy student at Greenwich University who did delivery work to earn some extra money, Yasin El Wahabi hoped one day to run his own business, possibly a milkshake bar. \r\n\r\n\r\nBorn at St Mary’s hospital in Paddington and brought up in North Kensington, Yasin, who was 20 when he died in the Grenfell Tower fire, went to Thomas Jones primary, Holland Park secondary and then Richmond College before securing the grades he needed to study for a degree. Academic work was a struggle at times, making his relatives all the prouder of his success in becoming the first member of the family to go to university.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Sellens, his primary headteacher, says Yasin was a “very handsome fellow – fit, strong and sporty”. The school was in the process of being turned around when he was a pupil there and Yasin, says Sellens, was part of the cohort that helped make that transformation happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nA supportive figure in the lives of his younger cousins, Yasin was a sociable and popular character who would help neighbours with bags and open doors. He had trained as a football referee and officiated at adult and children’s games. He is remembered for his kindness as well as his humour and youthful grin.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a statement, when he was formally identified, his family said: “Yasin was a loveable, bubbly and caring young man.

A niece working as chambermaid in London invited her to come work for a family, taking care of their three children. She arrived in London in June 1972 and fell in love with the city. She wrote back to her family to say how it made her feel so “posh”.\r\n \r\n“She loved the children and took care of them like her own,” says her older sister, Zenaida Purificacion. “We were always happy, too, when she sent money to our mother. It meant a lot.”\r\n \r\nThe children were grownups when Moore left for another job at a teahouse. This was where she met her husband, James Moore, a retired British soldier. “She said James was always at the teahouse and kept ordering from her and from her alone,” says Purificacion. \r\n\r\n\r\nThey were both in their 50s. “He was tall and very handsome. There was a photo of him carrying her on their wedding day. It was the happiest day of her life,” says Griego.\r\n \r\nAfter her husband died of cancer, Moore lived alone at their flat on the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower. With its view of the city, it was a building she loved and boasted about to friends and family back in the Philippines.\r\n \r\nIn 2012, aged 73, Moore returned to Manila for the first time for a family reunion. “She was so pretty. Even in her age, she loved to put on make-up and wear high heels,” says Purificacion. This was how she lived her remaining years: spending time with loved ones.

They were very close.” \r\n\r\n\r\nThe 32-year-old was brought to the UK from Sierra Leone by her father when she was a child but was no longer in contact with members of her family in Britain.

Working tirelessly to secure the future of her five children, she taught Arabic and art, upcycled handbags and shoes, designed Sudanese thubes – a garment like a sari – and threw open the doors of her 23rd-floor Grenfell Tower apartment on the slightest social pretext.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Her flat was beautiful, always full of people,” says Wafa Hussein Osman, who knew Alsanousi for almost 30 years. “Whenever we went there we found a new plant, a new vase, she loved antiques. She had this artistic side. She did loads of different things with her hands. She bought secondhand shoes and bags and redesigned them.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAlsanousi was born in Kordofan, south-west Sudan, in the early 1940s when it was still a British colony. She taught in primary schools all over the country, latterly in Khartoum. She married an army officer and they had five children. Friends are unclear on the circumstances of her departure but she claimed political asylum in Britain in the early 1990s.\r\n\r\n\r\nOsman moved to London at around the same time. “We found it very strange, cold and dark,” she says.

The series of photographs explores traditional Gambian spiritual practices, and it was this work that led Andrew Nairne, the director of Kettle’s Yard gallery, to meet Saye just before her death.\r\n\r\n\r\n“That she had created such a remarkable, powerful, original series of works was quite extraordinary,” says Nairne. “It’s an absolute tragedy – this was such a confident first body of work, but there was so much more to come.

A chubby-faced smiling child in pictures, the three-year-old was frequently shown hugging her five-year-old sister, Fethia. The sisters and their mother, Rania Ibrahim, died on the 23rd floor. It took months for the girls’ remains to be identified. \r\n\r\n\r\n“Hania was like me and her mother – she liked food,” says Rasha Ibrahim, her aunt, who likened Hania to a ‘little duck’ – one who babbled, but spoke little. “She liked to draw, and to play with colours.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRasha Ibrahim says her niece enjoyed meals of pizzas and burgers as much as traditional Egyptian food such as fesikh, a fermented fish dish. “The October before she died, they threw Hania a big birthday party,” she says. “Everyone was so happy. They made tons of food.” \r\n\r\n\r\nThe family is originally from Aswan in southern Egypt. Rania Ibrahim relocated first to Cairo then to London in 2009. Hania’s father, Hassan Hassan, was in Cairo owing to his brother’s ill health when he watched footage his wife posted online showing that the tower had caught fire. \r\n\r\n\r\nHania’s mother had disliked the family home on the 23rd floor of the Grenfell tower from the start, according to her sister. “She didn’t like staying there,” she says. “Before the family lived there, they had a temporary residence in a flat at the mosque. Rania went every couple of days to put some furniture in their Grenfell flat, but it took her ages to finish it.” \r\n\r\n\r\nRasha Ibrahim believes her sister was reticent to finish decorating the flat because she felt something bad would happen there, “as if she sensed the danger”. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs the building burned on 14 June, the two girls panicked while their mother welcomed anxious neighbours into their apartment, and Hania’s family in Cairo watched the fire that led to her death via a live-stream. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"What’s painful for me is that we talked on the day of the fire,” says Hania’s aunt. \"We laughed, and joked.

She would care for her classmates, making sure they ate and stayed calm while away from their families during the day.
