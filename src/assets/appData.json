In a matter of days, Nazanin Aklani fulfilled her mother’s wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n“She had got used to her flat at the 18th floor,” Aklani said. “She used to say: ‘It’s as if I’m on a plane, I can see the whole of London from up here.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrasiabi, 65, lived high up in the tower despite having a disability, walking with the aid of a frame. She was rehoused in Grenfell last year; her requests for an accessible flat did not yield any results.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrasiabi, who died along with her sister, Fatemeh, was born in 1952, the fourth of seven siblings in a large family from Abadan in western Iran. A tomboy with a sharp sense of humour,\r\nshe travelled a lot in Europe during her youth. When the Iran-Iraq war broke out in 1980, the family fled to Shiraz in the south. \r\n\r\n\r\nShe moved to the UK in 1997 after separating from her husband, raising her five children – two sons and three daughters – alone. She worked as a dinner lady at a nursery. Afrasiabi lived on the second floor of a property in Ladbroke Grove for 18 years before being rehoused in Grenfell. \r\n\r\n\r\n“She had a lovely heart,” Aklani said. “Anyone who had any problems would go to her. She helped a lot of refugees, she would shelter them in her flat, she would do things that people don’t do in this day and age. Everyone relied on her.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrasiabi obtained British citizenship and had a soft spot for the Queen. She loved to explore London on random buses, taking them to the end of the line and back.\r\n\r\n\r\n“She spoke English, she had a lot of Iranian friends, but also a lot of British and African friends; she had a lot of foreign friends,” Aklani said.\r\n\r\n\r\n“You’d go to her house and you’d see five to six people there all the time. She had grown to love Grenfell Tower. We had bought her new furniture and even installed a new kitchen. In her latter months, she was happy living there.” \r\n\r\n\r\nAfrasiabi’s son Shahrokh Aklani told the Grenfell inquiry: “That night… even though she was surrounded by fire and smoke, she told me ‘Don’t come’. In one sentence, she told me something that I couldn’t find in any books: the meaning of love. Unconditional love.”","Credit":"Saeed Kamali Dehghan"},{"Name":"Fatemeh Afrasiabi","Floor":"Non-resident","Age":"59","Nationality":"Iranian","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff0a52ae969f10c298db359b3760ff8bcc7e74e7/1216_104_602_602/140.jpg","Short-biog":"“My mother was a very artistic woman.

On the night of the fire, she was visiting her sister, Sakineh. Afrasiabi was a relative newcomer to Britain, arriving as a refugee in 2013.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was born in Abadan, western Iran, in 1957, into a family of seven siblings. She was first and foremost an artist – a painter, tailor, even doll-maker, and encouraged her children and grandchildren to nurture their artistic tendencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe married in 1975, but in 1980, when the Iran-Iraq war broke out, the family had to flee Abadan, living in Shiraz before moving to Isfahan, Iran’s leading tourist destination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose were tough years, her daughter Masoumeh recalled, with the family struggling to make ends meet. “My mother was a very artistic woman. She could even make earnings from her art and often we got our livelihood from it,” she said in video testimony played at the Grenfell inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n“She loved her children. She would do everything for us. She will always be a legend to me.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHer niece Nazanin Aklani said: “She was a very artistic and romantic woman. She had the most difficult problems in life, but still she was positive, nice and inspirational. She’d look at a flower and talk about it for a long time.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrasiabi always wanted to be a carpenter, Aklani said. “She liked painting and tailoring and making dolls. Sometimes, she’d sew something and would sell it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nShe lived in a small studio flat in Enfield, north London. Afrasiabi had health problems and spent a great deal of time with her sister at Grenfell Tower. On the night of the fire, Afrasiabi and her sister were taken to the 23rd floor by an Afghan family who were trying to help them, but both of them died.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had five children, all of whom lived in Iran. “She missed her children a lot and would FaceTime there and talk to them all the time,” Aklani said. “She would always say that I’ll see them again.” \r\n\r\n\r\nShe also remembered how her aunt loved sewing, but did not have enough money to buy a machine. “When I got married, my mother bought me a sewing machine. I never learned how to work with it, so I gave it to my auntie – she’d do a lot of work with it. She’d cut our trousers or sew us a cushion,” she said.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrasiabi’s dream was to visit Egypt. “She’d say ‘whenever I get my British passport, the first place I’ll go will be Egypt’,” said Aklani. “She was fascinated by the place and was hopeful. She’d say: ‘I’ll live at least for another 15 years, so I’ll get to see it.’”","Credit":"Saeed Kamali Dehghan"},{"Name":"Yasin El Wahabi","Floor":"21","Age":"20","Nationality":"British","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/e95f42ba0ee8b0feca49147d63639788240b8429/234_93_277_277/140.jpg","Short-biog":"The first in his family to go to university, he hoped one day to own a business","Long-biog":"A part-time accountancy student at Greenwich University who did delivery work to earn some extra money, Yasin El Wahabi hoped one day to run his own business, possibly a milkshake bar. \r\n\r\n\r\nBorn at St Mary’s hospital in Paddington and brought up in North Kensington, Yasin, who was 20 when he died in the Grenfell Tower fire, went to Thomas Jones primary, Holland Park secondary and then Richmond College before securing the grades he needed to study for a degree. Academic work was a struggle at times, making his relatives all the prouder of his success in becoming the first member of the family to go to university.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Sellens, his primary headteacher, says Yasin was a “very handsome fellow – fit, strong and sporty”. The school was in the process of being turned around when he was a pupil there and Yasin, says Sellens, was part of the cohort that helped make that transformation happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nA supportive figure in the lives of his younger cousins, Yasin was a sociable and popular character who would help neighbours with bags and open doors. He had trained as a football referee and officiated at adult and children’s games. He is remembered for his kindness as well as his humour and youthful grin.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a statement, when he was formally identified, his family said: “Yasin was a loveable, bubbly and caring young man. He would lend his hand to anyone who asked for help. He was loved by so many and his contagious smile will always be etched on our minds and hearts.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe lived with his parents, sharing a bedroom with his younger brother, on the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower.

He would involve and reassure everybody,” she says.\r\n\r\n\r\nMehdi was the doted-on youngest child of his parents, Abdulaziz and Faouzia El Wahabi, and in the words of his aunt Hanan Wahabi, “definitely the baby of the family”. \r\n\r\n\r\nShe added: “Because he was the youngest he was cared for a lot, bless him. He wasn’t spoiled in the sense that he would get anything he wanted but they all mothered him.” In photographs he invariably wears a broad smile.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe landing outside his family’s 21st-floor flat was used as a play area by Mehdi, his nine-year-old cousin Sara Chebiouni, who lived several floors down, and the daughter of a neighbour. Inside the flat Mehdi enjoyed playing Minecraft and with Lego. He had small toys including Minions, Furbies and fidget spinners “arranged all over his desk so there was no more space, he was like a collector”, remembers Sara.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe liked ice-cream and curry, and kept a squishy red, white and blue rocket toy on his bed.

At Holland Park school she had worked her way up to a higher stream and was full of ideas and initiative when it came to planning her future. \r\n\r\n\r\nHaving looked into teaching, her ambition was to be an occupational therapist, though she had yet to decide where to go for sixth form.\r\n\r\n\r\nLindsay Johnson, her nursery teacher, remembers a toothy smile, strong body and confident character. Her primary headteacher, David Sellens, says her “lovely, deep voice” made her a popular choice for poetry readings and he recalls her reciting Dover Beach by Matthew Arnold. Like the rest of her family, she had a sunny disposition. She was proud of what Sellens calls “exquisite handwriting”, and liked caring for plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had a habit of rolling up her shirt sleeves and generally wore trousers, teachers say, and could be cheeky but was also charming so was not often in trouble. Outside school she had many friends, used the gym and played an active role in the lives of her younger brother, Mehdi, and her nine-year-old cousin Sara Chebiouni, taking them to the park and the swimming pool.\r\n\r\n\r\n“She would have made a success of whatever she did,” says Johnson. “There was a robustness to her, and I think her family would have continued to be an important part of her life. I can also imagine her wanting a family of her own – she used to help in the nursery and was very good with younger children. You wouldn’t want to mess with Nur Huda but she was also this lovely, gentle, nurturing child.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNur Huda will be immortalised by having a character named after her in Philip Pullman’s next novel, thanks to a successful bid by one of her teachers in a fundraising auction.","Credit":"Susanna Rustin"},{"Name":"Marjorie Vital","Floor":"16","Age":"68","Nationality":"Dominican","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d45f4c48fb4093c36539d0b52060cc109fa6d6b/583_130_873_873/140.jpg","Short-biog":"“A joyful, kind, sensitive woman who dedicated her life to her children”","Long-biog":"Marjorie Vital was born in Soufrière in Dominica in 1948.

She would comb and braid my hair and bathe me. She was good at sewing and she sewed my school uniform.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHer life took a different turn when she had her first child before she was 16. Vital moved to London when she was pregnant with her second son and lived with her parents in North Kensington.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe moved into Grenfell Tower soon after it was built. “She liked living in the tower – she was very proud of her home, which was always neat and tidy,” Paula said.\r\n\r\n\r\nVital shared flat 162 on the 16th floor with her younger son Ernie, who also died in the fire.

Her work was exhibited last year at the Venice Biennale.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Khadija’s story is inspirational, it needs to be told so that other Khadijas in the world hear it,” says Nicola Green, an artist who had been a mentor to the 24-year-old for three years.\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn in London, Saye lived with her Gambian mother in a flat on the 20th floor of the tower. She had gone to a local school, but at 16 won a full scholarship to the prestigious Rugby school. \r\n\r\n\r\n“She was incredibly grateful for the experience, but she told me it was one of the most difficult things she had done,” says Green. “It was a completely different world to the one she was part of – she was living at the top of Grenfell Tower and the school was full of privileged people ... it gave her an understanding that confidence is a mysterious thing – I think maybe it gave her the tenacity and determination to find it in herself.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter school, Saye went to the University for the Creative Arts, where she was part of a tight-knit group of four women who lived and created together. One of the group, Lou Johnson, describes her as “one of the most remarkable people I have ever, and probably will ever, meet”.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer best friend, the photographer Charlotte Levy, recalls: “She was just the most incredible person; she went through so much stuff, but she always listened and was always there for you. She was making such powerful work, but still saying she didn’t have a clue. She was such a beautiful person. She lit up a room.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHer father, Muhammedu Saye, said in a statement to the opening of the Grenfell Tower inquiry that his daughter had opened up to him about her love of visual arts. Her burning passion was photography, encouraged by her mother. “Khadija said to me one day: ‘Daddy, I’m in love, with images.’ It was these images that Khadija pursued to the end because it gave her great satisfaction.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFriends described her close relationship with her mother, Mary Mendy, who also died. “Khadija had the most beautiful, soulful spirit, she was so deeply connected to her mother,” says Green.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaye had also faced financial barriers. “She was using her own money to fund her work,” says Green. “She didn’t know anyone in the art world, she didn’t come from that world, but she was so clear about her own work and her desire to create.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHer work Dwelling: in this space we breathe was exhibited at the Venice Biennale. The series of photographs explores traditional Gambian spiritual practices, and it was this work that led Andrew Nairne, the director of Kettle’s Yard gallery, to meet Saye just before her death.\r\n\r\n\r\n“That she had created such a remarkable, powerful, original series of works was quite extraordinary,” says Nairne. “It’s an absolute tragedy – this was such a confident first body of work, but there was so much more to come.

As a young woman in her native Manila she would genuflect in church in front of the Black Nazarene, a statue depicting a dark-skinned Jesus Christ, pleading for an opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n“It was always her dream,” her younger sister Estelita Griego recalls. “She prayed for it fervently.” She was desperate to escape – from the graveyard shift at a fishing port, and from a boyfriend who wanted to marry and settle down.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoore was 33 when her prayers were answered. A niece working as chambermaid in London invited her to come work for a family, taking care of their three children. She arrived in London in June 1972 and fell in love with the city. She wrote back to her family to say how it made her feel so “posh”.\r\n \r\n“She loved the children and took care of them like her own,” says her older sister, Zenaida Purificacion. “We were always happy, too, when she sent money to our mother. It meant a lot.”\r\n \r\nThe children were grownups when Moore left for another job at a teahouse. This was where she met her husband, James Moore, a retired British soldier. “She said James was always at the teahouse and kept ordering from her and from her alone,” says Purificacion. \r\n\r\n\r\nThey were both in their 50s. “He was tall and very handsome. There was a photo of him carrying her on their wedding day. It was the happiest day of her life,” says Griego.\r\n \r\nAfter her husband died of cancer, Moore lived alone at their flat on the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower. With its view of the city, it was a building she loved and boasted about to friends and family back in the Philippines.\r\n \r\nIn 2012, aged 73, Moore returned to Manila for the first time for a family reunion. “She was so pretty. Even in her age, she loved to put on makeup and wear high heels,” says Purificacion. This was how she lived her remaining years: spending time with loved ones. She doted on her neighbours’ children and on her great-nieces and -nephews back home. She loved to dance - she was an Elvis fan - and she loved to cook. \r\n\r\n\r\nShe was one of the last victims of the fire to be identified, her remains found alongside the steel ribs of her collection of umbrellas. “The coroner said you’d be dead if you breathe the smoke from the fire for 15 minutes,” says her niece, May. “She must have died in her sleep.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHer remains were returned to Manila, to be buried alongside those of her parents.","Credit":"Carmela Fonbuena"},{"Name":"Sheila","Floor":"16","Age":"84","Nationality":"British","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/d44981caf88a8fbcf64b64abb611424d04b20bd9/18_228_986_985/140.jpg","Short-biog":"\"We used to talk about politics, world affairs, Shakespeare, poetry, philosophy\"","Long-biog":"Sheila was “a beautiful woman, and she had a beautiful soul.

Brought up in the midst of the chaos of the Ethiopian-Eritrean war, she left Africa as a teenager and lived briefly in Italy before being granted asylum in the UK, and had put down deep roots in North Kensington since being housed in Grenfell around a decade ago. \r\n\r\n\r\nShe came from a big family, with three sisters also living in London and two more in Italy. Her sister Selamawit Tsegay, who lives nearby and with whom she spent a lot of time - both women were single parents, and Biruk was close to his cousin Hemene - says Berkti was \"very shiny, and beautiful. She used to say 'life is short' and she loved going out dancing and to clubs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nStill a teenager when she became a mother, as a single parent she took a strong interest in her son’s education and was well regarded by his teachers. Paul Enright, who taught Biruk in primary school, says she closely tracked his academic progress and arranged after-school tutoring. Colleagues at the cafe in Holland Park where she worked part-time, serving food, drinks and ice-creams, remember her talking about her son all the time.\r\nAdegboyega Phillips, her manager there, says his concerns about gaps in her English when he interviewed her evaporated when she worked a trial shift. “She made it work for herself basically,” he says, her warmth and liveliness more than making up for any lapses in grammar. “She was the life and soul, she used to crack us up a lot.” When she died she was working as a cleaner for King's College in Waterloo.\r\nAs well as a sister in London, she had a group of close female friends. She and her sisters attended various Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox churches around London, and always celebrated Christmas and Easter together. She had two nephews in London and a niece.\r\nParticular about her appearance, and of dressing up in both western and traditional Ethiopian-Eritrean clothes, she worked out at the gym, and was fond of wearing bright colours, dramatic jewellery, high heels and painted nails.

But football was his passion and he would write the name of the Brazilian star Neymar on all his test papers.\r\nBorn in London, he lived with his mother Berkti in a flat on the 18th floor of Grenfell Tower, and had three aunts also living in London. One of these, Selamawit, who lives nearby, says he was delighted when her daughter Hemene was born and used to help her by fetching dummies, nappies, or whatever she needed.

The month after Biruk died he had been due to go on his first foreign holiday, to Italy, and Selamawit says he couldn't wait to get on the plane.\r\nMother and son had a close, warm relationship, with Biruk described by those who knew him as a mature boy used to making his way around the neighbourhood on his own when his mother was at work, and as having embraced the move to secondary school. He had almost finished his first year when he was killed aged 12 along with his mother.\r\nHe is remembered for his distinctive chuckle and beaming smile. “He was extremely savvy, you could almost have an adult conversation with him,” says El-Ouahabi, whose son was friends with Biruk. “He could work out your moods from your expressions”. \r\nOxford Gardens staff remember him suited, booted and laughing at the year 6 leavers’ prom.

Working tirelessly to secure the future of her five children, she taught Arabic and art, upcycled handbags and shoes, designed Sudanese thobes (a sari-like garment) and threw open the doors of her 23rd-floor Grenfell Tower flat on the slightest social pretext.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbu Baker Ibrahim, one of her sons, told the Grenfell inquiry: “We were really happy as a family, and my mother worked hard in a foreign land to keep us together. She was a very loving person. Very caring. Excellent communication skills. Great sense of humour.\r\n\r\n\r\n“What amazed me is she did things that I didn't know about that were very charitable, and she kept it to herself.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWafa Hussein Osman, who knew Alsanousi for almost 30 years, said: “Her flat was beautiful, always full of people. Whenever we went there, we found a new plant, a new vase; she loved antiques. She had this artistic side. She did loads of different things with her hands. She bought secondhand shoes and bags, and redesigned them.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAlsanousi was born in Kordofan, southern Sudan, in the early 1940s, when it was still a British colony. Her upbringing was tough: her father had moved away to be with his second family, leaving her with a mother who did not work and a baby sister who needed caring for. \r\n\r\n\r\nHayat Alsanousi, her sister, told the inquiry: “She was 10 years older than me, and she was like a mother to me. I feel that she had adopted me as her child.”\r\n\r\n\r\nShe taught in primary schools all over the country, latterly in Khartoum. Alsanousi married an army officer and they had five children. After he died in 1984, life became a struggle for her, and she eventually claimed political asylum in Britain in the early 1990s.\r\n\r\n\r\nOsman moved to London at about the same time. “We found it very strange, cold and dark,” she said. Alsanousi quickly settled into her new life. She knew no English, so started language lessons. She needed money and found work in a packaging factory. Still feeling that she had much to give in the classroom, Alsanousi also taught Sudanese children at a Saturday school.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Fathia was a very resilient person, she was very practical,” Osman said. “She was a very happy woman, really happy. She was the pillar of the community in London, sort of like our godmother.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce she obtained a British passport, Alsanousi visited her homeland, principally to check up on her disabled sister, Hayat. \r\n\r\n\r\nHer three older children studied in Europe, but the two younger ones, Abufras and Esra, were not yet teenagers when they arrived in the UK and went to British schools, growing up more British than Sudanese.

She did not have the chance to go to school, and when she was bringing up her children in England, she would remind them how privileged they were.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer son, Nabil, recalls: “She used to say: ‘I wish I could have gone to school, I wish I learned English the way you learned it.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nChoucair left her parents when she was about 18 to marry a man from the same area who had travelled to London to work in a Lebanese restaurant. “It was a difficult decision for her to leave her family, to move to London, knowing she would have to spend her life here with no other relatives; she was very nervous not knowing anyone,” her son says.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe and her husband moved a few times in the 1970s and 80s, as their family grew to include four children – two sons and two daughters. After Choucair’s husband became ill, she took on three jobs to provide for the family, starting her days at 6am as a chambermaid in a west London hotel, before serving food to patients at the Royal Marsden hospital. She also worked as a domestic cleaner. Evenings were taken up washing clothes and preparing meals for her family, as well as stitching curtains, pillowcases and trousers. \r\n\r\n\r\nHer son says: “She was very busy. I don't remember her having time to relax; she had to come home, do the housework, make sure the clothes were washed. She wouldn't complain, she would just get on with it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nChoucair enjoyed her job at the Royal Marsden; by that time her English had improved (she spent years watching American soaps like Dallas and Dynasty, trying to become fluent) and she liked talking to patients and hospital staff. She saved so her children could attend a private Islamic school in west London. \r\n\r\n\r\n“Homework was very important to her; she wanted to make sure we had a good education. She wouldn’t have had time to come to parents’ evening because of her hours, but she would help us with our Arabic homework. She devoted so much of her time to her kids. It made her happy,” says Nabil.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery other year, if things were relatively stable in Lebanon, they would travel back to visit family. For the first 10 years that she had lived in London, she had not been able to return. There were no phones in the village, so all communication was done by letter, but Sirria could not write much. Nabil remembers hearing his mother dictating letters to his father. “They did that quite often; she would tell him to write: ‘Send kisses to the family from me.’” \r\n\r\n\r\nHer husband died in 2002, and around a decade later, Sirria Choucair moved to Grenfell Tower to be near her daughter Nadia, so she could help her with her grandchildren. She did not like the flat to begin with, and complained to her son about problems with the television aerial, lifts, leaks and a faulty intercom. “There was a nice view, but she didn’t like the fact that she was very high up, because she knew that if the lift wasn’t working, she would have problems.”\r\n\r\n\r\nChoucair made many friends at Grenfell: Nabil has lost count of the number of times people came up to him to say how much they loved her. “She wasn’t shy. She was full of surprises. I never knew they knew her. She made friends very easily. She spent a lot of her time being friendly with people.”","Credit":"Amelia Gentleman"},{"Name":"Husna Begum","Floor":"17","Age":"22","Nationality":"British-Bangladeshi","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd645488fe78e79e9b4b775ea28fc8a46bf8d8d9/544_677_140_140/140.jpg","Short-biog":"“She was the epitome of adventure and spirit”","Long-biog":"Husna Begum, the youngest of Komru Miah and Rabia Begum’s four adult children, was weeks away from her wedding when she died.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelatives said she had been shopping with her brothers and parents a few days before the fire, to prepare for the ceremony on 29 July and a party for 200 guests.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbdul Khan, 60, one of her cousins, said of Begum, who worked at Carphone Warehouse: “The last time I saw her, all she could talk about was the wedding.

She moved first to Saudi Arabia and then to London around the turn of the millennium. She met her husband Hashim in London through a mutual friend and they married in 2002.\r\n“Her joy was courageous and contagious,” said her sister-in-law Assema Habib in testimony to the Grenfell inquiry. “Being around her could lighten up anyone’s day in a matter of seconds. She was sociable, she could befriend absolutely anyone, no matter who they were, or what they believed in.”        \r\nNura loved nature and horses.

Friend after friend says she was exceptional: extrovert but humble, a prodigious reader, and linguistically gifted – she spoke Amharic, English and some Arabic.\r\nHer aunt, Assema Habib, told the Grenfell inquiry: “Firdaws was responsible and mature for her age since she was little. Her parents never worried about her. She never needed to be told to do her homework, clean her room, get ready to go out. She was always ahead of everyone.”\r\nSean Mendez, who runs Solidarity Sports, a charity that works with young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, knew Firdaws well. “She was someone who was just so easy to love,” he says. “You met her and you were just like, wow; whatever level you were she could inspire you.”\r\nBorn two months prematurely, Firdaws was the middle child of three. She died alongside her two brothers, Yahya, 13, and Yaqub, six, and her parents, Nura Jamal and Hashim Kedir, on the 22nd floor of Grenfell Tower.\r\nEmma Kibble, who taught her at Avondale Park primary school, described her in a report from the year before she died as an “incredible asset to our school”, with a “have-a-go attitude and a thirst for learning”. She singled out her talent for languages and wondered whether Firdaws would become a “scientist, doctor or professor” when she grew up. \r\nHer former headteacher Katy Blackler also held her in high regard, and praised her responsible and enthusiastic approach to her role as deputy head girl. “I’m sure you’ve heard she was brilliant at everything; but she was,” she says. “She was a great singer, and sportsperson, and speaker and all the children knew her. When I told them she had died there were big, big tears rolling down their faces.”\r\nMendez remembers Firdaws always being on hand to help if younger children were playing up. “She was so calm and kind and they looked up to her,” he says. “All children are special but Firdaws just had this thing that pulled you up and made you really think: here is someone who is destined for something important.

While the school's rule was that bikes and scooters should be pushed in the playground, most mornings Yaqub would have a go at scooting across before being told \"walk please, Yaqub\", Blackler recalls.\r\nRemembered as an entertainer who loved to dance and relished making others laugh, Yaqub came from a family of big personalities to whom he was strongly attached.\r\n“He was so full of life and energy and funny,” his aunt Assema Habib told the Grenfell inquiry. “It was impossible to spend a minute without laughing if he  was around. He never accepted being the little one; he always tried to show that he could do whatever [his siblings] Yahya and Firdaws were capable of doing.”\r\nHis cousins Hanan and Eliza told the inquiry: “It makes us smile when we think about how much energy you had, even from the very beginning. Even before you could walk, you would crawl around on the floor so fast we could barely keep up, and as you grew older, the crawling turned into walking, running and constant jumping and dancing.”\r\nAt school Yaqub is remembered for his dancing, his model-building and his love of sport, especially football.

He worked as a construction worker, a parking attendant, an electrician and finally did the Knowledge to qualify as a black cab driver.        \r\n“Hashim adored our father and never considered that the things he’d done to help the family were enough to pay back the life he’d sacrificed for us,” Assema said.\r\n“He was so clever,” added his older brother, Shemsu Kedir Habib. “From year 1 to year 12 he was always number 1 in the class.

And as the Persian saying goes, when he cooked, you’d lick your fingers. “He was witty and had a great sense of humour,” his cousin, Masoud Shahabedin, recalls. “He wanted to laugh and would tell you things to make you laugh as well.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 61-year-old’s flat at Grenfell Tower was adorned with traditional Iranian decorations, says Shahabedin. “He had a hubble-bubble [hookah] and a Persian samovar and he loved cooking because he worked as a chef in a Persian restaurant for several years.”\r\n\r\n\r\nShahabedin remembers Kani missing his cat when it died: “He got very upset. He was sad for a long time. We ask him to buy another cat but he said no other cat could replace it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cousins had moved to the UK in 1979 when Iran was in the throes of revolution. But that was not their motivation: they were young men seeking adventure and education. He went to college in Southampton to study A-levels but soon realised going to university was not his thing. “He wasn’t interested in studying. He was into arts, especially plays,” says Shahabedin. “He didn’t continue his education. After two years, he went to London and I came to Manchester.”\r\n\r\n\r\nKani, who never married, first found work as a waiter, but wanted to be an actor. “He even did a couple of Iranian plays, but had very junior roles,” his cousin says. \r\n\r\n\r\nKani had no other relative in the UK, but had a brother and two sisters in Iran. He came from Rey in southern Tehran. His father had his own shop selling bags and luggage and his brother worked for a telecommunications company.\r\n\r\n\r\nKani travelled to Iran at least twice a year and had a ticket booked for the week after the fire at Grenfell Tower, where he lived on the 18th floor. He was planning to move back permanently when he retired. His cousin says he had many friends: “He worshipped his friends; some Iranians were at his place all the time. But when his father died and his financial support [for Kani] finished, he lost a lot of friends.”\r\n\r\n\r\nKani would call Shahabedin at least once a week. “Every time we’d talk for 50 minutes, we would talk about Iran, our childhood, politics and the things he would read online. He spent a great deal of time on the internet, which was his biggest support,” he says.\r\n\r\n\r\n“He was happy with Grenfell. He had lived there for more than 20 years; his flat gave him peace.

Afghanistan was in the grip of civil war, Kabul was becoming less and less secure, and his wife was pregnant. \r\n\r\n\r\nNeda, a senior officer in the army, was alerted to specific threats to himself and his family. He chose to flee, as did many other members of his family, and eventually ended up in the UK with his young family in 1998. They were given a flat on the 23rd floor of Grenfell Tower, No 205.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing so far from home and having left behind a successful career, Neda could have been racked with regret and disappointment. But his son, Farhad Neda, says he threw himself into his work, setting about securing a future for his family. He became a minicab driver and latterly ran his own chauffeuring business. \r\n\r\n\r\n“He was the sort of person who would do anything for his family, to make sure his family had a comfortable life,” says Farhad. “I don’t remember him taking a day off work. He never said ‘I’m sick’.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Neda family adored their flat, with its spectacular views, light, airy aspect and spacious rooms. Farhad’s mother, Flora, is disabled and the council had suggested moving them. They refused. “We loved our home,” says Farhad.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis father doted on his only son, serving as driver, coach and cheerleader in chief for Farhad’s burgeoning taekwondo ambitions. \r\n\r\n\r\n“He used to drive me all over the country,” recalls Farhad. “I made it to the England team. He even went with me to international competitions in Poland, Belgium, Sweden. He was disappointed when I stopped. Until the day he died he was encouraging me to go back into it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the support that father gave son was life-saving. On the night of the fire, with flames already encroaching, Farhad Neda picked up his mother, put her over his shoulders and somehow brought her down 23 storeys via a stairwell. \r\n\r\n\r\nMohamed Neda stayed behind, possibly to help others trapped on the upper floors.","Credit":"Mark Rice-Oxley"},{"Name":"Mohammed al-Haj Ali","Floor":"14","Age":"23","Nationality":"Syrian","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2801d7063a906b3f682c7069a94ce9d6f7c4d64/123_55_378_378/140.jpg","Short-biog":"“He was always meeting people, telling us about the culture and how we needed to integrate”","Long-biog":"Mohammed al-Haj Ali was always kind, even as a little boy, says his father, Nedal. He remembers giving him five small coins in their hometown of Daraa in Syria: with them he bought four sweets and handed them out to his siblings, keeping none for himself. His mother, Heam al-Haj Ali, recalls him coming into the kitchen to help prepare meals, or acting as a host when guests came to visit. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe carried that selflessness and generosity into adulthood. When he and his older brother, Omar, escaped their war-torn country in 2014, he called his family every day. Not only his parents, but his many aunts and uncles who stayed behind. “He wanted to know how we were every day,” says his father. “He wanted to take our pain away from us.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of the Grenfell Tower fire, the 23-year-old was separated from Omar, whom he lived with, in the chaos and thick smoke. As Omar lay on the floor outside the building having made it downstairs, friends and family spoke to Mohammed on the phone. He was still trying to care for two of his neighbours; he told Omar’s friends to look after him. “He was thinking about me more than himself,” says his brother. \r\n\r\n\r\nMohammed al-Haj Ali’s future was bright. He was studying engineering, hoping to follow in the footsteps of his father. After a month working at Savers, he was made a supervisor. Before he his death he was working at the shoe store Ecco, and had taken on a second job at Harrods. \r\n\r\n\r\n“He was always the one meeting people, telling us about the culture and how we needed to integrate,” says his younger brother Hashem, who followed his brothers to the UK. “Because he could laugh and smile easily, he got to know people, he took the lead whatever he was doing.” \r\n\r\n\r\nHashem remembers that after he passed his first exams in English, Mohammed had organised for all of their friends to come to congratulate his brother. “They were all shouting and clapping, I was happy and proud,” he says. Mohammed had natural charisma, his father says, adding: “We would call him the chief of Arabs, just for fun.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMohammed al-Haj Ali had been house-hunting with Omar for a while when they found their two-bed flat close to both of their jobs and their studies. The brothers, who were looking to rent privately, did not have many options. They were students and the landlord was, fortunately as far as they were concerned, still willing to accept them as tenants. \"We liked it,\" says Omar now. \"We didn't know if it didn't have an alarm or a fire exit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAsked how they would like their loved one to be remembered, the family are quiet for a moment.

But the bonds of sisterhood proved strong over the years – strong enough to change lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nIbrahim turned into a tomboy, loving her time in the scouts, when she would get to ride her bike in the mountains with other children. She enjoyed school, particularly maths, English and IT. She discovered an unshakeable Islamic faith at an early age and wanted to be a lawyer. But life intervened.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer oldest sister, Sayeda, who was present at her birth and helped raise her, had moved to London. She had cancer, was without a husband and had four children aged under 10. In 2009, Rania moved to Britain to help her.\r\n\r\n\r\n“She came to live with me and made me feel so safe,” Sayeda told the Grenfell inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIbrahim met her future husband in the UK and they had two daughters, Fethia and Hania.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer sister, Rasha, said: “Rania did everything so fast, it’s as though she knew she was leaving life early. She loved making food and sharing it with her neighbours. She loved life.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIbrahim was a respected member of the local Muslim community and committed to her faith. “She was the perfect example of a Muslim woman living in a non-Muslim country,” her sister said. “She was elegant, and cared for herself – and for other people.” \r\n\r\n\r\nShe is most remembered by her family for her boundless positivity and sense of humour. “We loved to eat together, but it was always combined with a laugh,” her sister recalled. “We used to do crazy things together. I remember she was making pizza when I was with her once, and I got some flour and threw it on her. She was angry at first, but then she threw it at me – and then we ended up throwing it on everybody, including her kids. Our mother screamed at us!”\r\n\r\n\r\nIbrahim enjoyed documenting her life in London on social media, livestreaming family outings and funny moments. “She loved taking videos – lots of them,” her sister said. In the final video she posted, Ibrahim captured the view from her apartment window as she prayed. \r\n\r\n\r\nHer sister watched the fire that caused her sibling’s death from Cairo. “She called me and she was calm. She insisted she was OK. But then I saw the livestream on TV, and I knew she wouldn’t make it,” her sister said.\r\n\r\n\r\nRasha Ibrahim said her sister had a dream about the tower a month before the fire: “She dreamt that her parents were on different levels of the building.

A chubby-faced smiling child in pictures, the three-year-old was frequently shown hugging her five-year-old sister, Fethia. The sisters and their mother, Rania Ibrahim, died on the 23rd floor. It took months for the girls’ remains to be identified. \r\n\r\n\r\n“Hania was like me and her mother – she liked food,” says Rasha Ibrahim, her aunt, who likened Hania to a ‘little duck’ – one who babbled, but spoke little. “She liked to draw, and to play with colours.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRasha Ibrahim says her niece enjoyed meals of pizzas and burgers as much as traditional Egyptian food such as fesikh, a fermented fish dish. “The October before she died, they threw Hania a big birthday party,” she says. “Everyone was so happy. They made tons of food.” \r\n\r\n\r\nThe family is originally from Aswan in southern Egypt. Rania Ibrahim relocated first to Cairo then to London in 2009. Hania’s father, Hassan Hassan, was in Cairo owing to his brother’s ill health when he watched footage his wife posted online showing that the tower had caught fire. \r\n\r\n\r\nHania’s mother had disliked the family home on the 23rd floor of the Grenfell tower from the start, according to her sister. “She didn’t like staying there,” she says. “Before the family lived there, they had a temporary residence in a flat at the mosque. Rania went every couple of days to put some furniture in their Grenfell flat, but it took her ages to finish it.” \r\n\r\n\r\nRasha Ibrahim believes her sister was reticent to finish decorating the flat because she felt something bad would happen there, “as if she sensed the danger”. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs the building burned on 14 June, the two girls panicked while their mother welcomed anxious neighbours into their apartment, and Hania’s family in Cairo watched the fire that led to her death via a live-stream. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"What’s painful for me is that we talked on the day of the fire,” says Hania’s aunt. \"We laughed, and joked.

She said that her niece told her repeatedly that there were lots of things she wanted to tell her father. \r\n\r\n\r\nFethia was a soft-spoken but sociable child, and had a close relationship with her younger sister, Hania, three, and her cousin Moaz. \r\n\r\n\r\n“In kindergarten, Fethia was like a mother to her classmates,” her aunt says. “She was a leading character. She would care for her classmates, making sure they ate and stayed calm while away from their families during the day.

So Khadija hatched a plan: they would finish it themselves.\r\n“It was her idea mainly,” Abdullah said. “Look – what they are doing is not something that no one can do. Let’s put the cement on it, put the tile on it. I was doing this and she was doing the grouting.”\r\nIt is a tale that says much about the upbeat, can-do nature of Khalloufi, a Moroccan immigrant who had lived in west London for 30 years.\r\n“She was basically a very helpful lady to all the neighbours in need,” Abdullah said in a video commemoration shown to the Grenfell inquiry. “Any neighbour in need, she was there. She was always helping others and not helping me sometimes. For her, neighbours and friends come first.”\r\nKhalloufi was born in Morocco in 1964, the eldest of seven siblings in a family from the coastal town of Mohammedia. Her brother Karim Khalloufi told the Grenfell inquiry: “We considered her like a second mother due to her big heart, her impressive sense of responsibility and her enormous concern for the wellbeing of her family.”\r\n She studied accountancy and commerce in Casablanca, and worked in a pharmacy before travelling to London to seek greater opportunity and income to support her family.\r\nShe met her future husband at a business studies class in west London. He was the lecturer. “She gave me the right impression right from the beginning that she is the person for me,” he said.\r\nShe helped look after Abdullah’s mother until her death and was herself a mother figure to a stepson and stepdaughter from Abdullah’s first marriage.\r\n“We travelled a lot, especially by car, because she’s got family, acquaintances and friends in France, in Belgium, Holland, Germany and so on,” Abdullah said. “When I was free, we just jumped into the car and went.” They also visited Morocco regularly.\r\nAbdullah survived the fire, but lost contact with his wife during a terrifying exit from the building.

She used to sit on a particular bench, from which you can see the stage and watch the show.\r\n\r\n\r\n“In her role she met a kaleidoscope of people, but she was exactly the same with everyone. She didn’t adapt herself to fit in with others. A lot of people who come and work for us are at drama college or training to be singers, but others are just local working-class people, and Debbie was one of those.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLamprell was very close to her mother, said Volpe. “She rang her every day, saw her lots and texted her after work. Her father died a few years ago, and Debbie was an only child, so she looked after her mum.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of the fire, Lamprell reportedly texted Miriam at about 11.30pm to say she had got home safely. She was identified by dental records after her remains were found on the 23rd floor. \r\n\r\n\r\nHer funeral was attended by former school friends, said Volpe. “Debbie was still close to people she grew up with; they’d stayed friends. She was just an incredibly nice person.”","Credit":"Harriet Sherwood"},{"Name":"Ali Yawar Jafari","Floor":"10","Age":"82","Nationality":"Afghan","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8d5aff3ac0d9b845b02de95bf6356f88f149adc/0_471_2478_2477/140.jpg","Short-biog":"\"He always told us to enjoy life because it was short, to travel the world\"","Long-biog":"“He always told us to enjoy life because it was short,” recalled his son Hamid Ali Jafari. “He told us to travel the world and see everything.\r\n“He was a loving man. He used to love all the people around him: it didn’t matter if they weren’t family. He always told us to respect everyone. To do the right thing.”\r\nJafari began his working life as a jeweller in Afghanistan. He worked with precious stones and made rings and necklaces. “It was the family tradition,” said Hamid.\r\nWhen Jafari came to the UK in 1999, he was 64 and he struggled to learn English. He would spend his days at his friend's Afghan shop in Portobello market, talking about the old days and charming customers with his offers of tea in gentle, broken English.\r\nHis wife, Fatima Jafari, recalled in a video screened at the Grenfell inquiry: “He loved animals, he loved to travel. We went to Germany, we went to Iran. He always wanted to travel to see family and friends.”\r\nHis daughter Maria Jafari said: “He was a very loving person and a very caring person. He never said no to us.”\r\nHis eight grandchildren were the other focus of his life. “He spent hours playing cars with my three-year-old son,” said Hamid. “He would make all the noises of the different vehicles, all the emergency ones, and trains. He’d do it for as long as my son wanted – and that could be hours.”\r\n An early riser, Jafari happily looked after his grandson if he woke before the boy’s parents. “He would give him breakfast and talk to him until we woke up,” his son said.\r\n“My son is still asking after his grandfather. At the beginning, we told him his grandfather was away, but now we’ve told him the truth. Now when he sees photos of his grandfather, he says: ‘Fire, fire. Bad fire.’ It breaks my heart.”","Credit":"Amelia Hill"},{"Name":"Vincent Chiejina","Floor":"18","Age":"60","Nationality":"Unknown","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d0b303d9a7bfe90109689c76087fb3edb846f10/0_0_1158_1158/140.jpg","Short-biog":"\"He was good at looking after vulnerable people\"","Long-biog":"Vincent Chiejina was born in Nigeria but moved to Britain with his mother and sisters while still a boy, quickly taking to schoolwork, science fiction books and Star Trek. \r\n\r\n\r\nA bright young man, he passed A-levels and went on to study electrical engineering at Sheffield University in the mid-1970s. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut his family said he rejected a materialistic life for something more gentle and ascetic, becoming an active member of St Francis of Assisi Roman Catholic church in Notting Hill and an enthusiastic volunteer with the Open Age charity, which helps older people maintain an active, sociable lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn video testimony to the Grenfell inquiry, his sister Obi Chiejina said: “He was good at looking after vulnerable people [and] would never reject anybody because they were less privileged than himself.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVincent liked cooking, Obi Chiejina said, and could even make crisps at home.

If you were he’d make you laugh\"","Long-biog":"Gary Maunders, a painter-decorator from west London, was a father of four who relished the limelight. “He could talk,” Tammy Maunders recalls of her older brother. “He had so many stories to tell.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMaunders, 57, did not leave home until he was in his early 40s, playing a very active role in the early lives of his two nieces, Channel and Kenita Spence, who were brought up in the family home.\r\n\r\n\r\n“He was fun to be around – a real Peter Pan,” says Channel, recalling his fondness for Marvin Gaye and Manchester United. She remembers how he would take her out to the football pitch outside their house and pass on a few tips.\r\n\r\n\r\n“We grew up around him,” Channel says. “He had a heart of gold. He was the life and soul – when he entered a room he was the centre of attention.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t be sad around him. And if you were he’d make you laugh,” Kenita adds.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaunders was one of the few Grenfell victims who did not live in the tower; he was visiting a friend on the night of the fire, and died on the 23rd floor. But he was as rooted in the area as anyone and, apart from a few family holidays in Spain and Mexico, spent his entire life in and around the North Kensington area.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his latter years, he liked to pass on words of wisdom to the younger generation. “He was old school,” says Channel. “He loved to pass on his knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n“He was a massive part of our lives. We feel his absence. He is so missed.” \r\n\r\n\r\nChannel Spence writes:\r\n\r\n\r\nGary Maunders was extremely family-oriented; he loved his kids and mother dearly and was very fond of his nieces and nephews. Not a day passed where he wouldn't talk to his mother or kids. Every evening he'd call to ask how their day had been and if they were okay.\r\n\r\n\r\nGary had a big heart. He would help anybody in need and was very giving. He was an old-school gentleman: caring, respectful, knowledgeable, charming and witty. He would always say \"good morning\" to the older generation and offer to help them with their shopping trolleys or bags.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a young boy, Gary had the potential to become a professional footballer, after he got scouted by Arsenal. He wouldn’t fail to mention this nearly every time a match was on. But funnily enough, he later became a huge Manchester United supporter. He always said he never fulfilled his dream to be a footballer because of \"being young and chasing the women\", as he put it, and he became a painter and decorator instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis regret of his became a lesson for the children within the family, as he would forever try to encourage them not to go down the same path as he did. “Be good and stay in school,\" he always told them.","Credit":"Mark Rice-Oxley"},{"Name":"Abdeslam Sebbar","Floor":"11","Age":"77","Nationality":"Moroccan","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd7cb8df5ec1b7fb81413cb3b3c929b13c57fdcf/423_0_1049_1049/140.jpg","Short-biog":"Part of west London’s sizeable Moroccan community","Long-biog":"Abdeslam Sebbar was among the oldest victims of the fire and one of 11 people with Moroccan connections who died in Grenfell Tower.\r\n\r\n\r\nSebbar lived in a flat on the 11th floor, but little more is known about his life and attempts to contact people who knew him were unsuccessful.","Credit":"Guardian staff"},{"Name":"Anthony Disson","Floor":"22","Age":"65","Nationality":"British","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/761a5cfe2f98f361396bf6e8eab4949653159a4a/0_0_399_399/140.jpg","Short-biog":"Dapper sports fan and great-grandfather who was always the life of the party","Long-biog":"When Lee Disson remembers his father, he recalls a smartly dressed man stepping into a Jaguar, or perhaps a Triumph Stag, invariably on his way to a football match, boxing contest or perhaps a party.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootball, boxing, family, children: Tony Disson was west London through and through. Sociable, well-known and with a touch of the lovable rogue about him, Disson was born in Kensington and raised two families in west London. For the final 10 years of his life, he lived in a small apartment at the top of Grenfell Tower.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great-grandfather by the time he died at 65, Disson had worked as a refuse collector for the council, and latterly in car-breaking and scrap metal. But it is clear from speaking to those who knew him that he worked to live; and life was his beloved Fulham football club, the horses that he stabled under the Westway flyover, his four sons, and his social life.\r\n\r\n\r\n“He was a party man, definitely a party man,” Lee recalls. But he was also a good father, he adds. “I had a very happy childhood.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDisson would ferry his lads from one sporting event to another. He ran junior football teams and was a driving force behind a local boxing club that was set up in the basement of Grenfell Tower. \r\n\r\n\r\n“He took us all boxing,” recalls Lee, Tony’s eldest son, who admits he had little ability. Lee’s half-brothers, born to Disson’s second wife, Cordelia, were much more enthusiastic, and their father would take them all over the country to fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n“He was a funny person to be around,” said Charlie Disson. “Every morning before training, he would make me a fry-up. We'd have a joke and a laugh. The gym was at the bottom of the block. He'd start cleaning the gym while I'd train.\r\n\r\n\r\n“He wasn't the richest man in the world, but he was rich with love.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were joyous family holidays to the Isle of Sheppey, but also the sadness that comes with family breakdown. Tony left his first wife, Lee’s mother, when Lee was about 10. He remarried on new year’s eve in 1987, but he and his second wife separated about 10 years ago, although they stayed in touch.\r\n\r\n\r\n“He was a good dad, he loved his kids,” said Cordelia Disson. “He was a big part of our lives and always will be.” \r\n\r\n\r\nTony moved into a council flat on the 22nd floor of Grenfell Tower. By then, he had osteochondromas, a bone condition that also affects Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\n“We were more like friends through my teenage years,” says Lee. “When he moved into Grenfell, I bought him his first double bed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Lee, his father was up late on the night of the fire, returning to the building after midnight. If he had stayed away for another half an hour, he might have survived.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a statement, the family said: \"Tony was the most generous person you could ever meet. He didn't have much but would always be there to help people. He had a great sense of humour, especially in the face of the practical jokes the boys would play on him.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is survived by Cordelia, four sons, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.","Credit":"Mark Rice-Oxley"},{"Name":"Victoria King","Floor":"20","Age":"71","Nationality":"British","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb319d460492df4331e9475daaf70e26f9e6891f/0_0_500_500/140.png","Short-biog":"\"She and Alexandra were devoted to one another\"","Long-biog":"Victoria King was one of the last victims of the fire to be identified, a long-term Grenfell Tower resident who lived on the 20th floor with her daughter, Alexandra Atala. \r\n\r\n\r\nLittle more is known about her life.
