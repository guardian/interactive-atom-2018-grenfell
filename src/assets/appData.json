In a matter of days, Nazanin Aklani fulfilled her mother’s wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n“She had got used to her flat at the 18th floor,” Aklani says. “She used to say: ‘It’s as if I’m on a plane, I can see the whole of London from up here.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 65-year-old lived high up in the tower despite being disabled, walking with the aid of a frame. She was rehoused in Grenfell last year; her requests for an accessible flat did not yield any results.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrasiabi, who died along with her sister, Fatemeh, on the 23rd floor, apparently while seeking an escape route, had moved to the UK in 1997. She lived on the second floor of a property in Ladbroke Grove for 18 years before being rehoused in Grenfell. \r\n\r\n\r\n“She had a lovely heart,” Aklani says. “Anyone who had any problems would go to her. She helped a lot of refugees, she would shelter them in her flat, she would do things that people don’t do in this day and age. Everyone relied on her.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrasiabi came from Abadan in western Iran, close to Iraq. When the Iran-Iraq war broke out in early 1980s, the family fled to Shiraz in the south. She moved to the UK after separating from her husband, raising her five children – two sons and three daughters – alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had requested to be rehoused in 2000 because her flat did not have a lift, but she never succeeded in securing more suitable accommodation. She had an earlier bid for a flat on the ground floor declined because “it was not step free”.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrasiabi worked briefly for Punch and Judy nursery in Earl’s Court but could not continue because of her deteriorating health. \r\n\r\n\r\nAklani adds: “She spoke English, she had a lot of Iranian friends but also a lot of British and African friends, she had a lot of foreign friends. You’d go to her house and you’d see five to six people there all the time. She had grown to love Grenfell Tower. We had bought her new furniture and even installed a new kitchen. In her latter months, she was happy living there.”","Credit":"Saeed Kamali Dehghan"},{"Name":"Ali Yawar Jafari","Floor":"10","Age":"82","Nationality":"Afghan","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8d5aff3ac0d9b845b02de95bf6356f88f149adc/0_471_2478_2477/140.jpg","Short-biog":"\"He always told us to enjoy life because it was short, to travel the world\"","Long-biog":"“He always told us to enjoy life because it was short,” recalls his son, Hamid Ali Jafari. “He told us to travel the world and see everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n“He was a loving man.

When she died, she was getting ready to teach a knitting and crochet class at the Westway Trust community centre, where she sold her handmade scarves and baby clothes, with the profits going back to the trust. \r\n\r\n\r\nUntil she married and moved to London aged 20 in 1995, Faouzia had lived in Larache, a coastal town in northern Morocco, with her parents and grandmother. She had known her future husband, Abdulaziz El Wahabi, and his family all her life. When the pair were reintroduced by older relatives after Abdulaziz told them of his wish to settle down, they fell in love.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn London, they moved in with her mother-in-law until they were offered a two-bedroom flat in Grenfell Tower when her first child, Yasin, was one. Yasin, his aunt remembers, was a difficult baby who childminders struggled with, and Faouzia’s early attempts at working outside the home in a school kitchen were given up in favour of full-time parenting.  \r\n\r\n\r\nYasin was followed by a daughter, Nur Huda, with whom Faouzia enjoyed following Moroccan dramas and soap operas on TV. Then there was a seven-year gap before Mehdi, the baby of the family, arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n“You would always see her laughing and joking with her children, whenever you saw her out they would be with her,” says her sister-in-law and former neighbour, Hanan Wahabi. “That’s how she was with them, and every single one of them was a parent to Mehdi – it was a unique situation they had.” \r\n\r\n\r\n“There was a real sweetness to her, but beneath that there was a real desire to ensure her children got on,” says David Sellens, the headteacher at Thomas Jones school where two of the El Wahabis’ children were pupils.","Credit":"Susanna Rustin"},{"Name":"Yasin El Wahabi","Floor":"21","Age":"20","Nationality":"British","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/e95f42ba0ee8b0feca49147d63639788240b8429/234_93_277_277/140.jpg","Short-biog":"The first in his family to go to university, he hoped one day to own a business","Long-biog":"A part-time accountancy student at Greenwich University who did delivery work to earn some extra money, Yasin El Wahabi hoped one day to run his own business, possibly a milkshake bar. \r\n\r\n\r\nBorn at St Mary’s hospital in Paddington and brought up in North Kensington, Yasin, who was 20 when he died in the Grenfell Tower fire, went to Thomas Jones primary, Holland Park secondary and then Richmond College before securing the grades he needed to study for a degree. Academic work was a struggle at times, making his relatives all the prouder of his success in becoming the first member of the family to go to university.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Sellens, his primary headteacher, says Yasin was a “very handsome fellow – fit, strong and sporty”. The school was in the process of being turned around when he was a pupil there and Yasin, says Sellens, was part of the cohort that helped make that transformation happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nA supportive figure in the lives of his younger cousins, Yasin was a sociable and popular character who would help neighbours with bags and open doors. He had trained as a football referee and officiated at adult and children’s games. He is remembered for his kindness as well as his humour and youthful grin.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a statement, when he was formally identified, his family said: “Yasin was a loveable, bubbly and caring young man. He would lend his hand to anyone who asked for help. He was loved by so many and his contagious smile will always be etched on our minds and hearts.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe lived with his parents, sharing a bedroom with his younger brother, on the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower. Some friends say that on the night of the fire, with residents scrambling to get out of the building, Yasin ran the other way - to get back up the stairs and help rescue his family.","Credit":"Susanna Rustin"},{"Name":"Mehdi El Wahabi","Floor":"21","Age":"Eight","Nationality":"British","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/64c2b88bbc732d4f0ddb66b80dcaaef9beb20d1f/413_5_333_333/140.jpg","Short-biog":"\"Had he lived to adulthood he would have liked to be a comedian\"","Long-biog":"Just eight when he died and about to finish year three at Oxford Gardens primary school, within sight of his home in Grenfell Tower, the headteacher, Sarah Cooper, remembers Mehdi El Wahabi coming in dressed up as a caveman. “He had a wonderful sense of humour but was also very, very gentle. He would involve and reassure everybody,” she says.\r\n\r\n\r\nMehdi was the doted-on youngest child of his parents, Abdulaziz and Faouzia El Wahabi, and in the words of his aunt Hanan Wahabi, “definitely the baby of the family”. \r\n\r\n\r\nShe added: “Because he was the youngest he was cared for a lot, bless him. He wasn’t spoiled in the sense that he would get anything he wanted but they all mothered him.” In photographs he invariably wears a broad smile.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe landing outside his family’s 21st-floor flat was used as a play area by Mehdi, his nine-year-old cousin Sara Chebiouni, who lived several floors down, and the daughter of a neighbour. Inside the flat Mehdi enjoyed playing Minecraft and with Lego. He had small toys including Minions, Furbies and fidget spinners “arranged all over his desk so there was no more space, he was like a collector”, remembers Sara.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe liked ice-cream and curry, and kept a squishy red, white and blue rocket toy on his bed.

At Holland Park school she had worked her way up to a higher stream and was full of ideas and initiative when it came to planning her future. \r\n\r\n\r\nHaving looked into teaching, her ambition was to be an occupational therapist, though she had yet to decide where to go for sixth form.\r\n\r\n\r\nLindsay Johnson, her nursery teacher, remembers a toothy smile, strong body and confident character. Her primary headteacher, David Sellens, says her “lovely, deep voice” made her a popular choice for poetry readings and he recalls her reciting Dover Beach by Matthew Arnold. Like the rest of her family, she had a sunny disposition. She was proud of what Sellens calls “exquisite handwriting”, and liked caring for plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had a habit of rolling up her shirt sleeves and generally wore trousers, teachers say, and could be cheeky but was also charming so was not often in trouble. Outside school she had many friends, used the gym and played an active role in the lives of her younger brother, Mehdi, and her nine-year-old cousin Sara Chebiouni, taking them to the park and the swimming pool.\r\n\r\n\r\n“She would have made a success of whatever she did,” says Johnson. “There was a robustness to her, and I think her family would have continued to be an important part of her life. I can also imagine her wanting a family of her own – she used to help in the nursery and was very good with younger children. You wouldn’t want to mess with Nur Huda but she was also this lovely, gentle, nurturing child.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNur Huda will be immortalised by having a character named after her in Philip Pullman’s next novel, thanks to a successful bid by one of her teachers in a fundraising auction.","Credit":"Susanna Rustin"},{"Name":"Marjorie Vital","Floor":"16","Age":"68","Nationality":"Dominican","Pic-url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d45f4c48fb4093c36539d0b52060cc109fa6d6b/583_130_873_873/140.jpg","Short-biog":"“A joyful, kind, sensitive woman who dedicated her life to her children”","Long-biog":"Marjorie Vital, a textile worker and longtime Grenfell resident, was devoted to her two children, grandchildren, and adopted home.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally from Dominica, Vital came to Britain as a girl.

They got married at the school and moved to London, where their son, Sam, was born in 1982.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family initially lived in Smyth’s father’s basement apartment, but moved to Grenfell Tower when a council flat became available on the 13th floor – recently renumbered as floor 16 – in 1983.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniels, who had served in the Indian air force, later worked in security at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai.

Sam, beginning to feel the effects of smoke, went to find help.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the stairs, Sam met firefighters and told them his father was disabled and he had been unable to get him to leave the flat.

A niece working as chambermaid in London invited her to come work for a family, taking care of their three children. She arrived in London in June 1972 and fell in love with the city.

They were very close.” \r\n\r\n\r\nThe 32-year-old was brought to the UK from Sierra Leone by her father when she was a child but was no longer in contact with members of her family in Britain.

Fathia Alsanousi was equally at home in both, a teacher and mother from the Sudanese hinterland who managed to make a second life for herself in exile once the first had become untenable.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlsanousi was something of a diaspora matriarch, and there were few London-based Sudanese who didn’t know of her. Working tirelessly to secure the future of her five children, she taught Arabic and art, upcycled handbags and shoes, designed Sudanese thubes – a garment like a sari – and threw open the doors of her 23rd-floor Grenfell Tower apartment on the slightest social pretext.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Her flat was beautiful, always full of people,” says Wafa Hussein Osman, who knew Alsanousi for almost 30 years. “Whenever we went there we found a new plant, a new vase, she loved antiques. She had this artistic side. She did loads of different things with her hands. She bought secondhand shoes and bags and redesigned them.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAlsanousi was born in Kordofan, south-west Sudan, in the early 1940s when it was still a British colony. She taught in primary schools all over the country, latterly in Khartoum. She married an army officer and they had five children. Friends are unclear on the circumstances of her departure but she claimed political asylum in Britain in the early 1990s.\r\n\r\n\r\nOsman moved to London at around the same time. “We found it very strange, cold and dark,” she says. Alsanousi quickly busied herself into her new life. She knew no English so started language lessons. She needed money and found work in a packaging factory. Still feeling she had much to give in the classroom, she also taught Sudanese children in Saturday school.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Fathia was a very resilient person, she was very practical,” Osman recalls. “She was a very happy woman, really happy. She was the pillar of the community in London, sort of like our godmother.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce she obtained a British passport, Alsanousi visited her homeland, principally to check up on her disabled sister Hayat. \r\n\r\n\r\nHer three older children studied in Europe, but the two younger ones, Abufras and Esra, were not yet teenagers when they arrived in the UK and went to British schools, growing up more British than Sudanese.

Her work was exhibited last year at the Venice Biennale.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Khadija’s story is inspirational, it needs to be told so that other Khadijas in the world hear it,” says Nicola Green, an artist who had been a mentor to the 24-year-old for three years.\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn in London, Saye lived with her Gambian mother in a flat on the 20th floor of Grenfell tower. She had gone to a local school, but at 16 won a full scholarship to the prestigious Rugby school. \r\n\r\n\r\n“She was incredibly grateful for the experience, but she told me it was one of the most difficult things she had done,” says Green. “It was a completely different world to the one she was part of – she was living at the top of Grenfell Tower and the school was full of privileged people … it gave her an understanding that confidence is a mysterious thing – I think maybe it gave her the tenacity and determination to find it in herself.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter school, Saye went to the University for the Creative Arts, where she was part of a tight-knit group of four women who lived and created together. One of the group, Lou Johnson, describes her as “one of the most remarkable people I have ever, and probably will ever, meet”.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer best friend, the photographer Charlotte Levy, recalls: “She was just the most incredible person; she went through so much stuff, but she always listened and was always there for you. She was making such powerful work, but still saying she didn’t have a clue. She was such a beautiful person. She lit up a room.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFriends described her close relationship with her mother, Mary Mendy, who also died. “Khadija had the most beautiful, soulful spirit, she was so deeply connected to her mother,” says Green.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaye had also faced financial barriers. “She was using her own money to fund her work,” says Green. “She didn’t know anyone in the art world, she didn’t come from that world, but she was so clear about her own work and her desire to create.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHer work Dwelling: in this space we breathe was exhibited at the Venice Biennale. The series of photographs explores traditional Gambian spiritual practices, and it was this work that led Andrew Nairne, the director of Kettle’s Yard gallery, to meet Saye just before her death.\r\n\r\n\r\n“That she had created such a remarkable, powerful, original series of works was quite extraordinary,” says Nairne. “It’s an absolute tragedy – this was such a confident first body of work, but there was so much more to come.

A chubby-faced smiling child in pictures, the three-year-old was frequently shown hugging her five-year-old sister, Fethia. The sisters and their mother, Rania Ibrahim, died on the 23rd floor. It took months for the girls’ remains to be identified. \r\n\r\n\r\n“Hania was like me and her mother – she liked food,” says Rasha Ibrahim, her aunt, who likened Hania to a ‘little duck’ – one who babbled, but spoke little. “She liked to draw, and to play with colours.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRasha Ibrahim says her niece enjoyed meals of pizzas and burgers as much as traditional Egyptian food such as fesikh, a fermented fish dish. “The October before she died, they threw Hania a big birthday party,” she says. “Everyone was so happy. They made tons of food.” \r\n\r\n\r\nThe family is originally from Aswan in southern Egypt. Rania Ibrahim relocated first to Cairo then to London in 2009. Hania’s father, Hassan Hassan, was in Cairo owing to his brother’s ill health when he watched footage his wife posted online showing that the tower had caught fire. \r\n\r\n\r\nHania’s mother had disliked the family home on the 23rd floor of the Grenfell tower from the start, according to her sister. “She didn’t like staying there,” she says. “Before the family lived there, they had a temporary residence in a flat at the mosque. Rania went every couple of days to put some furniture in their Grenfell flat, but it took her ages to finish it.” \r\n\r\n\r\nRasha Ibrahim believes her sister was reticent to finish decorating the flat because she felt something bad would happen there, “as if she sensed the danger”. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs the building burned on 14 June, the two girls panicked while their mother welcomed anxious neighbours into their apartment, and Hania’s family in Cairo watched the fire that led to her death via a live-stream. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"What’s painful for me is that we talked on the day of the fire,” says Hania’s aunt. \"We laughed, and joked.
