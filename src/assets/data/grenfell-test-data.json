His brother Omar, 25, who was also in the flat but managed to escape, told the BBC Mohammed did not follow as he scrambled downstairs in smoke so thick he could not even see his fingers. The two brothers fled Syria three years ago. Omar said when he got outside, he realised his brother was not with him. He called and asked: “Where are you? I thought you were with us.” Mohammed replied he was in the flat, and no one had come for him. “He said, ‘Why you left me?’” said Omar, breaking down. A friend said he spoke to Mohammed on the phone until the student said he could speak no longer. The friend heard cracking, and the phone disconnected. Omar told the BBC: “I saw the fire in the flat from outside. I was watching the flat. It was burning and my brother was inside. The thing is we came from Syria to be safe here and now we are dying here”.\n\nThe brothers escaped the Syrian city of Daraa three years ago and were given asylum in the UK. Mohammed worked for the Syria Solidarity Campaign. In a statement the organisation’s co-founder Abdulaziz Almashi said: “Mohammed undertook a dangerous journey to flee war and death in Syria, only to meet it here in the UK, in his own home. Mohammed came to this country for safety and the UK failed to protect him.” Formally identified by the police in agreement with the coroner.",
